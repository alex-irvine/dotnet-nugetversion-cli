# dotnet-version-cli

This repository contains the source code for an [NPM version][1] inspired cli tool for dotnet core.

Once installed it provides a `dotnet version` cli extension which allows you to easily bump `patch`, `minor` and `major` versions on your project.

We do not aim to be 100% feature compatible with `npm version` but provide the bare minimum for working with version numbers on your libraries and code.

Please head over to the `develop` branch to see the latest development
